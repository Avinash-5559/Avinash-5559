## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** with over **3 years of experience** in ensuring software quality through **manual, functional, and API testing**. 

Over time, my passion for improving test efficiency and accuracy has led me to **transition into automation testing**. 

I’m now focused on developing strong skills in **Java, Selenium, TestNG, and REST Assured** to build scalable and reusable automation frameworks for UI and API validation.

My hands-on experience in **Postman** and **MySQL** helps me ensure data consistency and seamless API functionality. 

I believe quality assurance goes beyond finding bugs — it’s about driving reliability, fostering collaboration, and continuously improving with every release.
